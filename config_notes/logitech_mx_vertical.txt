CONNECTION
	BLE skips
	use Logitech Dongle for better tracking

SCROLL
	natural direction means iPad style - this is what I expect
	Apple driver (default, no Logitech or USB Overdrive)
		preferences > mouse: natural scroll = on
			note: this may also affect trackpad
	Logitech driver 
		*not* natural direction
		cannot be changed
		Apple mouse settings do not affect it
	USB Overdrive
		could not seem to modify scroll
		this broke Magic Keyboard
