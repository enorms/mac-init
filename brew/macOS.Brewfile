### tap (third-party repositories)
## run first because brew will search for and prioritize an official brew version if avail.
## brew tap <user/repo> makes a shallow clone of the repository at https://github.com/user/repo.
## After that, brew will be able to work on those formulae as if they were in Homebrewâ€™s canonical repository. 
## You can install and uninstall them with brew [un]install, and the formulae are automatically updated when you run brew update
